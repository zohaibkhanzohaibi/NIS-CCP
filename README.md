🛡️ Cryptanalysis of the Composite Vigenère CipherThis project presents the design, implementation, and security analysis of a custom Composite Vigenère Cipher. We rigorously evaluated its resistance against both statistical (Frequency Analysis) and algebraic (Known-Plaintext Attack) methods, identifying critical structural weaknesses and proposing necessary security enhancements.🧑‍💻 Project TeamNameRoll NumberLaibah ShahidCT-22061Tooba KashafCT-22068Haiqa SiddiquaCT-22071Muhammad Zohaib KhanCT-22072🔒 The Composite Vigenère CipherThe cipher utilizes a multi-round, hybrid approach that iterates a sequence of Caesar Shift and Vigenère operations, repeated for the full length of the key ($\mathbf{|K|}$):$$\text{Encryption} = (\text{Vigenère}_K \circ \text{Caesar}_{k_r})^{\times |K|}$$This design was intended to maximize confusion (Vigenère) and diffusion (iterative shifts).📊 Cryptanalysis Findings SummaryOur analysis confirmed that the cipher is fundamentally flawed due to its linear modular structure.1. Frequency Analysis (CPA) ResultsThe statistical attack showed vulnerability is highly dependent on ciphertext length ($\mathbf{L}$).Attack MethodKey Length m≥10Key Length m≤7Frequency Analysis (CPA)Highly Secure ($\mathbf{0\%}$ Success)Highly Vulnerable ($\mathbf{100\%}$ Success for $L \ge 300$)2. Known-Plaintext Attack (KPA) ResultsThe algebraic attack exposed the ultimate weakness:Resulting Vulnerabilitym∈{4,10,12} (gcd(m, 26) = 2)m=7 (gcd(m, 26) = 1)KPA Success Rate100% (Instantly solved)100% (Instantly solved)Key Space ReductionReduced to $\approx \mathbf{2^m}$ possibilities (e.g., 2,048 keys for $m=12$)Reduced to a trivial 2 candidatesThe KPA demonstrates that the cipher's linear structure allows the key space to be mathematically decimated, making the system unfit for secure communication.💡 Recommendations for ImprovementTo secure the cipher against the discovered linear vulnerabilities, the following structural changes are essential:Disrupt Linearity: Introduce Inter-Columnar Key Mixing and use Nonlinear Modular Mapping to prevent attackers from solving the modular congruences.Break Symmetry: Implement a Keyed Initialization Vector (IV) to randomize the aggregate key sum ($\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{total}}$) term, eliminating the critical KPA outer loop.Irregular Scheduling: Employ a variable or irregular key application schedule to remove the mathematical repetition factor ($\mathbf{m \cdot k_t}$) that causes ambiguity.📂 Project File StructureFile/DirectoryDescriptionEncrypt_decrypt.ipynbCore Cipher Implementation (Encryption and Decryption logic).Frequency_Attack.ipynbCode and analysis for the Frequency Analysis Attack (CPA).Known_Plaintext_Attack.ipynbCode and analysis for the Known-Plaintext Attack (KPA).README.mdThis documentation file.frequency_analysis_attack/Contains performance data (.csv) and visualizations (.png) for the statistical attack.known_plaintext_attack/Contains performance data (.csv) and visualizations (.png) for the algebraic attack.
